# Infrastructure Setup

This section contains documentation for the core infrastructure used in this project.

It covers the base network components required to get everything running smoothly for a LAN or home lab setup.

## Structure

- **Router/**
  - Focused on router configuration (mainly OpenWRT).
  - Also includes a placeholder for OPNsense, in case other platforms are added later.

- **Switch/**
  - A few general notes about switch setup. No detailed guide, as it heavily depends on your hardware.

The goal here isn’t to provide every single step for every possible device, but rather to document the choices and setup steps that worked for **my environment**—and hopefully provide a useful starting point for others doing something similar.
