# OPNsense (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for potential future documentation related to OPNsense or similar routing platforms like pfSense.

At the moment, my focus is entirely on OpenWRT, and no setup or config steps for OPNsense are included here.

The only reason this folder exists is to keep the `Routers/` directory looking clean and structured on GitHub. ðŸ˜‰

If youâ€™re looking for OPNsense documentation, check out:
