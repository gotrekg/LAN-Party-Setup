# LTE Setup

This document provides the steps for setting up LTE connectivity on my specific OpenWRT setup. These steps are tailored to **my hardware configuration** and **network environment**, so **please note** that they may not apply directly to other LTE modems, routers, or service providers. Due to the large number of variables involved (such as modem models, firmware versions, and regional settings), **support for other devices or configurations is not provided**.

The goal of this guide is to offer a **generic** overview of how I set up LTE on my OpenWRT router, which can be adapted to other setups with the appropriate modifications.
