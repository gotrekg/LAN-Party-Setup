# 01 - Installing Debian for LANCache

This part is just the usual install routine. Nothing fancy or custom yet — just laying the foundation.

## 🖥️ Steps

1. Download the Debian 12 ISO (netinst or full image — your choice)
2. Create a bootable USB stick using your favorite tool
3. Boot from the USB on the LANCache machine
4. Go through the install process — follow the on-screen instructions

## ✅ Notes

> **⚠️ Multi NIC Setup:**  
> If your system has more than one network interface card (NIC), please read [10-multinic.md](10-multinic.md) **before proceeding further**.

- Nothing special needs to be configured at this point
- Just make sure the system boots, connects to the network, and installs successfully
- **For this guide, I will be using only the onboard NIC.**
