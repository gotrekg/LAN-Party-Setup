# 01 - Installing Debian for LANCache

This part is just the usual install routine. Nothing fancy or custom yet ‚Äî just laying the foundation.

## üñ•Ô∏è Steps

1. Download the Debian 12 ISO (netinst or full image ‚Äî your choice)
2. Create a bootable USB stick using your favorite tool
3. Boot from the USB on the LANCache machine
4. Go through the install process ‚Äî follow the on-screen instructions

## ‚úÖ Notes

- Nothing special needs to be configured at this point
- Just make sure the system boots, connects to the network, and installs successfully
- For the installation, i have used the onboard NIC. The 10G NIC will be configured later with LACP.
- We‚Äôll do the fun setup stuff in the next steps
